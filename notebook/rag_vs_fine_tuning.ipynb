    "## PROBLEM DEFINITION\n",
    "\n",
    "How many times have we faced a problem of not having 'enough ammount of data' when we have to solve a text classfification task? In fact, sometimes we have enough data for some categories but not for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some teams choose complex model without considering whether simpler methods might perform better, other teams abandond the problem...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, I make a deep exploration of that issue and try to answer the above question. To do that, I compare two approaches, the **BERT model**, that is one of the best classifying texts; and a simpler method but very usefull in many scenarios (indeed, is the core component of most RAGs systems), the **cosine similarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of the present work is to extract sub-samples of the dataset in order of increasing size, then training both models on them and compare the results on a common validation dataset: Is better using BERT regardless of training size set? If not, why? Does cosine similarity works better in any scenario?"

    "## APPROACH\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the problem I used the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For DATA PROCESSING**:\n",
    "    - `pandas` and `numpy` libraries used to manipulate the data.\n",
    "    - `sklearn` library used to split the data, encode the categorical target, and compute the cosine similarity.\n",
    "    - `evaluate` library from Huggingface used performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For BERT MODEL**:\n",
    "    - `transformers` library from Huggingface used for tokenization and fine-tuning.\n",
    "    - `datasets` library from Huggingface used to format data correctly.\n",
    "    - `torch` library used to ensure the model is training with gpu.\n",
    "    - `GPU RTX 4090` (in runpod.io) to train (fine tune) the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For COSINE SIMIALRITY**:\n",
    "    - `openai` and `langchain` where used to call the api for the embedding model (text-embedding-3-small).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For VISUALIZATIONS**:\n",
    "    - `plotly`"

    "## STEPS\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the task, I followed these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LOAD DATA**: Load the data and make analisys to understand the basics statistics. Here, after inspect the text lengths, I decided to join `headline` and  `short_description`, into a column named `news`, which became our input feature.\n",
    "* **DATA PROCESSING**: Since we are using the BERT model and the OpenAI embedding model, we do not have to do a deep cleaning of the data. BERT model uses a tokenizer function, which makes the neccesary pre-processing to the text; and OpenAI embeddings were trained to capture the context of any real world text. If we would clean the text, we could remove valuable context.\n",
    "\n",
    "I encoded the `target` and build 11 subsets of the data following the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First the `validation` set: 30% stratified sample of the full dataset, preserving class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, the `training samples`: Those are the stratified samples which will serve to train the models on training sets of increasing sizes to check the performance evolution of the models. To build them, I went through a loop where, in every iteration we make the subsample of `p` proportion where `p` is in [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1]. Finally, we have to compute another partition over this `train dataset`, one to fine tune BERT and the other to test the performance and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`BERT` PIPELINE**:\n",
    "    1. I had to implement 3 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * `fine_tune`, which returns the trained model and the tokenizer.\n",
    "        * `tokenize_function`, which returns the tokenized data.\n",
    "        * `performance`, which compute the performance of the model on the `validation` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. The loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Iterate through proportions, `p` = [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1].\n",
    "        * Using the 3 previous functions, for each `p`, fine tune of the model over the corresponding training dataset, and evaluate the performance on the `validation` dataset and save it into a csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Cosine Similarity` PIPELINE**:\n",
    "    1. I had to implement 1 function:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * `similarity_performance` which has 2 main functionalities:\n",
    "            + Computes the `embeddings` of the news of the training dataset and with that, computes similarity matrix. To prevent memory overflow I had to iterate on the `embeddings` matrix by batches of rows.\n",
    "            + Compute the `performance` of the `Cosine Similarity` over the `validation` dataset and save it into a csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. The loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * For each, `p` = [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1], to load the corresponding traing dataset, perform prediction, and save the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PERFORMANCE ANALISYS**:\n",
    "    I choose the **f1-score** to measure the model performance. Since the target has many categories, f1-score is a good choice as it balances precision and recall and handles class imbalance well.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To make the comparison fair, both models were evaluated on the same `validation` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The following, are the main things that we have to know about this analisys:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. I had to implement 3 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * `general`, function to plot performance and training set size for each `p`.\n",
    "        * `top_categories`, same as above but focused on the 3 most frequent and 3 least frequent classes.\n",
    "        * `f1_data`, function to build a convenient dataset for the visualization, with `Category`, `F1-Score`, `prop` and `n_rows_label`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Sections **Performance similarity process** and **Performance BERT process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        In both sections I show: \n",
    "\n",
    "        * The evolution of the performance (on the `validation` dataset) of the models as the training size increases.\n",
    "        * The same as above but focused on the top and bottom 3 categories by frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Section **BERT VS Similarity based on training data size**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        In this section I show:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Comparison of performance trends of both models, overall and for 'extremes' categories.\n",
    "        * Analysis of how many categories improve as more training data is available."
